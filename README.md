# SoYummy Food Project

[Project Demo](https://basesnel.github.io/project-yummy-f/main)

Hi! It`s our final project completed after a one-year studying course at <a target="_blank" href="https://goit.global/ua/">GoIT academy.</a>.<br>
We have done a web-app, which can be used either as a cookbook, or as a source of yummy recipes. <br>
Database - MongoDB <br>
The backend part is done by some enthusiasts of our team with Node.js.
Hope you`ll enjoy our job. We intend to improve it and ourselves as frontend and full-stack developers. <br>
And now, we are looking for our first commercial experience. Wish as good luck :)
